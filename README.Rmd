# calibreinterface

The goal of calibreinterface is to read information from your local calibre ebook manager. We read from the database, never write, because that might corrupt your calibre instance. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of calibreinterface from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("calibreinterface")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RMHogervorst/calibreinterface")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```
